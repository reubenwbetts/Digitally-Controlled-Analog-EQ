This project was started using EasyEDA, which did not include gerber export. After the project was submitted PCB design was moved to KiCad, which allowed the mounting board PCB to be uploaded as a set of gerber files. 

All this board does is connect different though-hole sockets together (and a simple 5v generator with a regulator), so a schematic was not needed.
